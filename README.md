Configuration
=============
The script reads configuration from a ini file.
Use config_template.ini file as a configuration template. Copy it or edit in place.
Provide configuration file as `-c/--config` parameter. Default configuration file name: `config.ini`


The worklog naming convention
=============================
The name of the worklog starts with the issue key to which we want to log time.
Optionally after the key, there is a separation string " - " and the next element is a worklog description.

Planned functionalities:
- to indicate that the worklog should be registered with overtime attribute right after the separation string " - "
  should appear "(!)" string.


Exit Codes
==========

* 0 - ok 
* 1 - an error while connecting to the JIRA
* 2 - an error while reading the input file
* 3 - a parse file error
* 4 - an issue with the given key does not exist
* 5 - the file is already processed
* 255 - not implemented function

Output files
============

After successful processing of the input_file in the same directory as input_file output files will be created. 
out_{file_name}.csv - for correctly processed rows, 
err_{file_name}.csv - for rows that wasn't processed correctly.

How to process input file again.
--------------------------------
